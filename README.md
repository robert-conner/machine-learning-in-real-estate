## Description
This paper extends previous research (Choy et al., 2023) on real estate pricing predictions using machine learning. It introduces additional models - Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) - to test their accuracy alongside previously used algorithms. The study focuses on combining property age with square footage to enhance predictive performance and evaluates the effectiveness of these new models compared to traditional methods.

## Features
- Integration of Advanced Machine Learning Models: Incorporates KRR, SVR, and MLP alongside Extra Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest algorithms.
- Enhanced Predictive Performance: Combines property age with square footage to capture land depreciation effects and improve accuracy.
- Comprehensive Model Comparison: Evaluates performance against traditional hedonic price models and previously used machine learning algorithms.
- Detailed Analysis: Provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each model, considering computational demands, interpretability, and predictive accuracy.

## How It Works
- Model Specification: Details the methodologies and formulas behind KRR, SVR, and MLP regression techniques.
- Data Collection/Preprocessing: Describes the dataset used, including data collection methods and preprocessing steps.
- Model Implementation: Explains the process of implementing and fine-tuning the machine learning models, including hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation.

## Getting Started
- Ensure all dependencies are installed, including Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.
